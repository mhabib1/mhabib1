<h4 align="center">After graduating from University of Manitoba with focusing in Computer Science and Statistics, I have been very much interested in Web Development. I began my journey of web development with carrying forward all the knowledge I obtained about programming from University and started working with ReactJs. I'm looking for a permanent career as a Software Engineer that will allow me to contribute to amazing software and grow as a developer.
